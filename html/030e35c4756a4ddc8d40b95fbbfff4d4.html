<p><strong>Welcome to the Open edX Demo Course Introduction.</strong> This is where you can explore how to take an edX course (like this one). Most courses have an "intro" video that shows you how it all works. </p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-size: 16px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">You can watch the introduction video (below) or scroll though the course studies and assignments using the toolbar (above).  Just for fun, we'll keep track of your work in this demo course, and show you your progress in the toolbar just like in a real course.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; font-size: 16px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">Watch the overview video (below), then click on "Example Week One" in the left hand navigation to get started.</p>
