00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,760
what does it mean to be human if we don't have a shared culture

1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,820
and what is a shared culture mean if you can't share it so it's only in the last hundred

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,610
or 150 years or so that we've started tightly restricting how that culture gets used the

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,540
internet enabled an infrastructure where anybody could participate without asking permission

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:22,320
we have all these new technologies that allow people to express themselves take control

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,060
of their own creative impulses but the law is getting in the way Creative Commons is

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,940
designed to save the world from failed sharing people who actually want to share stuff who

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,250
put it up on the web because they want to share in our certain terms so we wanted to

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,739
create a simple way for creators to say to the world here's the freedom that I want to

9
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,970
run with my creative work here the things you're allowed to do can i reproduce it can

10
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,200
I copy it can I put it in my text book can I use that photograph can I make a new version

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,739
of it Creative Commons gives tools to creators to make a choice about copyright Creative

12
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,680
Commons license can cover anything that copyright covers every license says you need to give

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,830
me attribution I created this give me credit for the work I did the basic choices are commercial

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:15,990
use or not can you make derivative works versions adaptations or not and do you want me to have

15
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,020
to share alike so if I take your stuff do I have to offer it to the next person under

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,959
the same terms there's no requirement for you to do anything with your work other than

17
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,270
what you want to do you own the copyright to what we've done is given you the right

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,799
to exercise your copyright in more ways more simply so the idea here is to enable that

19
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,139
creative impulses that the technology turns lose and get the law out of the way the work

20
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:45,369
of Creative Commons is really about laying the infrastructure groundwork for this new

21
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:49,819
type of culture a new kind of folk culture somebody from delis somebody from New York

22
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:55,189
somebody from Singapore can feel comfortable using a photo that was created and given away

23
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,510
by someone in the United States or in China or wherever that the licenses have been with

24
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,359
their identity being preserved which means that people can actually create new kinds

25
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,880
of things come together and build things mashups that people can do with people's Flickr photos

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,470
and ccmixter has allowed artists to make music together it's really about creativity and

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,860
connection access and control from amateurs who simply for the love of what they're doing

28
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,510
and they want to share it and they want other people to be able to make use of it to commercial

29
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,500
organizations in the end this will have a very successful place in the for-profit economy

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,470
Creative Commons is the bridge to this future is you got to move away from thinking about

31
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,250
content to thinking about communities communities to develop around content and the sharing

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,230
that the licenses allow enable these communities to come together a physical commons is like

33
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,870
a part where anybody can enter equally the commons with intellectual works is actually

34
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,500
much freer it really is going to be the pillar for communications between people cultural

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,990
exchange the space for more speech more free expression and that's the kind of commons

36
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,490
we're trying to create
